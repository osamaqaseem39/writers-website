    title: "Where is my home?",
    content: `Is it just me or is the night really falling?
Is it true that the leaves are really shedding?
I was standing on the shore and I heard someone calling
Me? How could it be when I was beheading?
Soft tears were rolling down my cheeks
As I saw night getting colder and darker
I tried hard to stifle my shrieks
As I knew what the coldness was after
They told me that they loved me
But does love die when you die?
My body was floating on the black sea
Waiting for them to say goodbye
It kills when you have no one
Is it a sin to be alone?
Drowning myself under the scorching sun
I thought about the truth unknown

What if I have no home?
Do my prayers go in vain?
My tears were useless as I mourn
For my heart which was still in pain
They buried me alive in the sand of my sins
In the hallways of regrets roamed my soul
You read my story through scars on my skin
And you still wonder where is my home?`,

    title: "Lost in the Moonlight",
    content: `Lost in the night with a lantern in my hand 
On a winter's night, I stood on a starlit land 
Waiting for stars to twinkle on the charcoal sheet
I remembered the cold night when he held me in the street 
I was burning as I was greeted by millions of stars 
That made me remember how I got these scars
I was silently praying as the darkness was getting cold 
For the love that was no longer mine to hold
You were afraid of the dark, so I became your firefly 
Now that only ash is left of me, you said goodbye
Look at the winter's moon shining on the New Year's night 
Hold my lantern, I want to look for my dying love tonight 
They say lovers meet when it's moonlight
But O my love, it's already midnight
Your love is in my heart, burning like a flame 
Moon is here, but you? You never came`,

    title: "What Was My Fault?",
    content: `It was a lovely night with the wind softly caressing the dried leaves. A nightingale's sweet melody could be heard far away on the hills, soothing the blackened waves in the ocean. The street was dimly lit by a faint lamppost, casting a haunting glow on the dried petals strewn along the pavement. The moon was hiding behind the silver lining of the clouds. A lonely star was twinkling somewhere in the blood-red sky. Or was it burning? 

The window was slightly open, inviting the night's melancholy dance into the room. She was standing in front of the mirror, wearing a red dress that was hugging her knees. Her brownish hair was tied into a ponytail, and her soft smile lit up the room. I caught a glimpse of her in the mirror and our eyes locked. 

Her hazel-colored eyes widened in surprise. How could someone's eyes be deeper than an ocean? I wanted to get lost in those eyes, lose sight of myself, and hold her little finger to protect me from the waves. A soft smile flickered on the corner of her lips as if she had pierced my soul. She raised her eyebrows, and I blushed. My cheeks reddened. I could feel the blood hugging my cheeks. Were they redder than the blood on my knuckles? I shook my head. Not now. I wanted to look at her, lock her in my memory, and visit it when a shadow visits me. That shadow was visiting me more frequently. 

A shiver ran down my spine and I took a deep breath, not letting my anguish carry me away. I just wanted to hold her and feel the soft texture of her skin. Will her touch free me? Or will it make me lose my mind? Why couldn't I have her? I could see her from the corner of my eye, and she was looking more beautiful than ever. Her lips were touching the cup of her hot coffee, and I wanted to trace my finger on it. I wanted to know what it felt like to be held by her.

We all crave warmth. Don't we? 

I looked at my hands. They were bruised, carrying small scars. Are they really small? I looked at my jacket. It was ruffled. What could I do? My hair was a mess. I ran my fingers over the dark stubble of my cheeks. A lump formed in my throat. I tried to swallow it. Swallow everything. I looked at the candle flickering on the floor. The flame was burning. I could smell it. Could she smell it too? Could she see me? Like really see me. 

She was now applying nail paint on her nails. They looked perfect. It was dark and cold. Should I give her the blanket? I looked around but couldn't find it. It was getting colder. The leaves were whispering, and the window opened. 

I shivered. It was so cold. I panicked. She might catch a cold. It must be so difficult for her to be in this small cottage. Where was the blanket? Why couldn't I close the window? Why was it jammed? I rushed to close it. The nail pierced my skin, and blood fell on the floor. I hissed in pain. It was too much. My back was stinging. I was losing my mind. I didn't have time to lose. I have to do something to keep her warm. I looked under the bed to find something. But nothing could be done. There was nothing. I didn't want to look anymore and then a noise startled me. 

I looked up instantly to embrace my biggest fear. I was alone. She was gone. My heart was beating louder than the beating drums. It was in my throat. Something caught my eye. A crack in the mirror. I rushed to see it. It was small but the mirror was no longer the same. I lost it. I couldn't control it anymore. I screamed over my lungs. The moon disappeared. The star burnt. I looked in the mirror. 

There was a shadow with bloodshot eyes. Those eyes were burning. I smashed my hand in the mirror, slicing my finger. I unzipped my jacket and threw it away. Cut my hair. Tried to control my erratic heartbeat. Could she see my scars? Did they scare her? Or did she see the wounds that did not leave any scars? A tear fell into the ocean. It was no longer red. There was so much I wanted to say, so many unsaid things were buried within me. But why couldn't I say them? Why was my tongue tied? Will I always lurk around the dark rooms? Will I only embrace the darkness? I wanted to give her the world, but the world wasn't meant for me.`,

    title: "Who Baked Those Cookies?",
    content: `'Why is the sky so red?'

I closed my windows and looked at the unmade bed. The pillow was lying on the floor, and the candle was flickering. The rain was splattering against the windowpanes, sending shivers down my spine. I chose to ignore it, but my nightmare wanted to embrace me.

I shivered, trying to snub my heartbeat, which was beating louder than the marching drums. It was getting cold. I tried to zip up my jacket, but my trembling hands froze midway. I stared at the darkness. I stared at the cold, sickening silence. I stared at the blank wall, inviting me into an abyss of unending agony.

I shook my head, distracted by the aroma of freshly baked cookies. They felt like a fresh breath of air. My heartbeat slowed down. My head stopped spinning. I felt as if my nightmare was over. For now.

I lit up a candle and went to take a shower. The cold water was stinging my skin. It left a long-forgotten scar. I exhaled, trying to distract myself from what was waiting for me on the kitchen counter. I was busy shampooing my hair when a sudden thought chilled my bones.

'Who baked those cookies?'

My world stopped. I froze. There was someone behind me. I could feel it. I could feel someone's stare ripping my soul. I could feel my life leaving my body. I could feel the sun setting in. I could feel my laughter echoing in the corridor. I could feel my body turning into ashes.

'Is this you?' The voice asked. It was soft, like honey. It scared me. I shuddered in fear. My heart was struck in my throat. I couldn't move. It took me back to my childhood days. I was alone, but not alone. I didn't want to cry. I didn't want to shed the unshed tears. I didn't want to look at the wounds—the wounds that were screaming right now. I didn't want to remember the long, sleepless nights. I didn't want to remember my empty hand. I didn't want to remember the loneliness that put my soul on fire.

It was completely dark in the bathroom. There was no soul in sight. But that soul could be felt. Its existence was larger than life. I stood there, refusing to move. I stared at my bloodshot eyes in the mirror. My stubble had grown.

'Is this you?' The voice asked again, angry this time. It came closer. I could feel it crawling against my skin, touching the sweat beads on my back. I flinched. My body was getting hot. It was weighing down. I couldn't move. No word escaped from my mouth.

The voice touched my neck. It was finding its way to go deeper and deeper into the abyss to see my tormented soul. Wasn't my soul already on fire? What could I give him? A broken heart? Do hearts really matter? What could broken things fix? I couldn't even fix my brokenness after so long. I couldn't forget the hands that burned me when I was dying to be saved.

I shook my head meekly.

His hand touched my arm, burning it. The touch wasn't soft. It was aggressive, like a nightingale whose melody couldn't be heard. I closed my eyes, burying the unsaid words. Where do I carry the burden of those unsaid words? Do we have any graves for that?

Where do I put the burden of my saddened heart? The haunting memories that were buried there. The untold stories that could never meet the shore. The agony of waiting and wanting to be loved. Or heard.

That hand kept touching my wounds, one by one. Those fingers weren't soft and were not steady. They were circling around my untouched wound, tasting the fragrance of it. I could feel the nails biting my skin. Blood oozed out, falling on the candle and extinguishing it. A long silence prevailed. I couldn't see anything, not even the shadow devouring me. The time had stopped.

I was staring into the emptiness, counting my seconds, when the hand traveled its way to my heart, and I screamed. I screamed to death. I screamed louder than I had ever screamed. My heart collapsed. My body ached. My limbs burned. My throat dried. My fingers trembled. My chest heaved. And my eyes cried.

I hit the shadow, ran, and hid myself under the bed. It was so cold and dark in there. I hugged my arms. I closed my eyes. I tried to control my erratic heartbeat. I couldn't do it. Not anymore. There was no one. It was only me.

Only me.

Why? Why was it only me? Why couldn't I ever say it? Why was I so weak? I bumped my fist into the floor, knocking on it violently. My knuckles were hurting and bleeding, but I didn't stop. The monster inside me was raging. It couldn't calm down now. The volcano of grief erupted. Pain shot up my arm. I kept pounding the floor and hammering it until my strength began to wane. I roared with each strike. My sweat was mixing with the blood on my fists.

The lightning struck. I struggled to breathe. I clutched my fist. Slowing down, I tried to touch my heart with my trembling hands. They were shaking so badly. My world was going to end. I was weighed down by the burden of the words that never got the chance to touch my lips.

I opened my eyes, and a tear rolled down my cheek. Then another. One after another, tears hugged my cheeks. I sobbed like a baby who cries when he cannot find his mother. I sobbed, knowing my mother was not there. I sobbed, realizing she would never be here. I sobbed, questioning why life was so unfair. Why was I left alone? Why do I have no one? Why was everything so sad? Why was it dark?

Why was the sky red? Why was the shadow not leaving me?

Why were my nightmares not going away?

Why am I here? Why did I have to embrace the darkness?

Why couldn't I be loved? Why were my tears drowning me?

I was lost somewhere in this world. No one came after me. I tried to wipe away the stray tears that nearly betrayed me, and I was going to close my eyes when I heard someone closing the bathroom door.

It didn't shock me. My heart didn't beat. My body didn't shiver. I just silently waited for it to come. I have been waiting for it for as long as I can remember. It was time.

The shadow was there, right in front of me. Looking at me with surprised eyes. I tried to smile, not realizing it was a melancholic smile. Even the smile felt distant. Tears didn't want to bid adieu to me.

The shadow touched me again. This time, I looked at the hands. They were again soft. Soft like a baby's hand. They looked so familiar. The scent was so familiar. The touch was so familiar. I was thinking of touching it when a tear fell on my hand. It wasn't mine. I looked up at him. It was his. It shocked me.

He was looking at me with sorrow in his eyes. But there was something else too. It wasn't just sadness. Was it love? I had never tasted it. Was it pity? I had never experienced it. Was it regret? I could even smell it from a distance.

My heart swelled with an unnamed emotion.

'It's you,' the voice whispered, distracting me from my trail of thoughts. 'It's you who never said anything,' the voice broke. It felt like the voice was tired of drowning in all the tears. It was breaking and hurting. It was a craving to be free. But what he said was true.

I was scared. My heart started beating again. I looked straight at him, realizing for the first time that it was me.

That shadow was me.

    title: "Cookie Jar",
    content: `It was raining outside. And the sound of raindrops splattering against the windowpanes woke him up. When his eyes opened, he could only smell the rain, feel it and see it. His room was flooded with darkness. He had closed the windows before going to bed last night as he anticipated a storm early in the morning. And he thanked God for his instincts. It was morning, and the sun was hidden behind the grey linen of clouds. It was a beautiful view, a beautiful feeling which was stirring up happiness inside him. There was a smile on his face, a sparkle in his eyes which was shining brighter than a diamond in a dark room. It was the day. Slipping his feet in his slippers, he went to take a quick shower. After stepping out of the bathroom, he opened his wardrobe and chose a dark blue hoodie with navy jogging pants. He was going to stay at home but…

It was his favorite color.

He smiled while tying his shoelaces and headed to the kitchen. He also cleaned the kitchen last night. He cleaned the floor, washed the dishes, cleaned the cabinets with a new detergent he found in the supermarket, and brought some scented candles. Their fragrance was very refreshing. She loved them. He remembered when she bought them, and on every occasion, she would light the flame. The whole home would light up with her love and fragrance. His heart melted. It was in pain. He didn't know how things went wrong. Or why they went wrong. They were living a happy life. It was difficult not to delve deeper into the past which almost scarred your whole life. Which made you a prisoner. 

There was no room for sadness today. And so, he smiled as he took in the whole view. It was not every day he would clean his house but sometimes. And today was one of those days. He went to the cabinet and after finding the cookie jar which he tied with a blue ribbon, took it out and very gently placed the cookies on a glass tray. It took him hours to bake them yesterday, but he cherished every moment of it. Some got burnt too. But even those burnt cookies tasted good. After decorating the tray with some sprinkles, he looked around and noticed it was dark inside the house, and his little one would get afraid. The rain didn't seem like it would slow down. It was getting wild. What if he doesn't come? His heart stopped beating at the mere thought. He didn't want to think about it. He should have gone to pick him up, but…

Shaking his head, he went to the lounge and found a lantern under the wooden table. It was a very special lantern which his father gifted to him. Even after all these years, he kept it safe. When it would glow, it would seem as if he wasn't alone. The night would get less cold, and the cold would not be that icy. All through his life, he remembered one thing. You can't lose your parents. No matter what. Sighing deeply, he picked it up, lit it, and hung it over the hook. Slowly, the room didn't look as if it was accustomed to darkness for years, as it started glowing like fireflies twinkling in a jar to the music of raindrops. It looked like a staircase of Heaven. It looked magnificent with all the balloons hanging from the ceiling, with a gigantic teddy bear holding a basket of candies on the sofa, with confetti turning and tossing on the floor, with birthday presents kept in stacks on the dining table. He will be so happy. He bought that transformer set which he always wanted. His heart was going in loops as he imagined Riley's giggles when he would open the birthday presents. His birthday present. 

Time seemed to pass in a flow, like a rippling wave washing away the seashells from the shore. It felt calm. Looking at the old clock chiming half-past eleven on the wall, he tried to calm down his erratic heartbeat. But it was of no use. Counting seconds on his fingertips, he smiled when it was time. Oh, my. He set up the table, poured orange juice in two glasses, and rummaged through the drawer to find a candle. While he was finding it, he heard a knock at the door. His heartbeat quickened, and he hurriedly went to open the door. He hoped he looked okay. 

'Dad!' Riley's sweet voice felt like a soothing melody to his ears, 'good morning!!!' He stood there, wearing a blue hoodie and black pants which were folded from the ankles. His tiny arms were opened widely to hug his father, and Harry smiled when he looked at him. All beautiful. All sweet. 

Harry opened his arms, lowered down, and held his son in his embrace. His hair smelled of strawberry. Just like her. 'Good morning, champ.' He was so happy to see him, 'And Happy Birthday, my beautiful boy.' He smiled while hiding his face in Riley's shoulder. He hugged him tightly and listened to Riley's heartbeats. It was so soothing. He missed that sound.  

Riley giggled. 'Thankyou. And morning, Dad.' They hugged for some seconds outside the home when Riley said, 'Dad. It's wet outside. It's raining,' he whispered in Harry's ear, 'let's get inside. Mommy won't like my wet clothes.'

He looked at Riley's clothes. His pants were getting wet. Oh, my. 'Oh, yeah, buddy. Daddy forgot it's raining,' he smiled apologetically, 'let's go inside. I don't want my beautiful son to catch a cold.'

Once they were inside, Harry lowered Riley to the floor but held his finger. Riley had the softest hands, and he was holding his father's hand tightly. He was so small. He had the cutest smile, the cutest giggle, the cutest laugh. His warmth was enough for Harry to sleep at night. Sometimes, he would remember when all three of them would sleep together in the same bed. Cuddled all night. Go for a walk around the town in the morning and have breakfast. Riley loved cookies and she loved bacon. He remembered all of that. 

'Woah, Dad!!!!' Riley's energetic voice brought him back to the present. He was looking at the decoration, and when he spotted the teddy bear, he went to it and hugged it. 'Looook, Daddd!!!! This bear is so biggg.' He swooned over the bear, and then showed his hands to Harry, 'Look, Dad. Bear uncle gave me some candies,' he grinned, opened one of them, and ate it. 'Woah. It's vanilla. I love vanilla,' he giggled. When he was done with the bear, his attention shifted towards the table, and he got up from the sofa while chewing the candy, 'I can smell cooookiesss. I can smell cookies, Dad.' His eyes were sparkling like fairy lights on Christmas Eve. He ran over to the table and jumped excitedly. 'Look, Dad. Cookiess!!!' He opened the jar. 'You didn't forget my birthday. I love you, Dad!!' He put his hand inside the jar and took out two cookies.

Throughout the entire scene, throughout the excitement of Riley jumping everywhere, Harry couldn't stop feeling the sense of pride which was slowly tucking at his heart. This home got lonely. It felt empty. Dark. Cold. And Harry knew it would never be the same again. But now he was so happy, his heart was so overdriven with emotions that he felt it would burst. It might shatter at any moment. He smiled when he looked at Riley eating the cookies. 'How can I forget my son's birthday?'

Riley grinned, showing his missing front tooth. 'That's why you are the best dad ever. I can't forget my dad's birthday too,' he said with a mouthful of cookies. 'I know when it's your birthday.'

'When is my birthday?'

Riley thought about it for a moment. His eyes narrowed and his finger was rubbing his forehead. 'Soon, Dad,' he whispered and giggled. 

Harry laughed. 'You are right, son. It's soon,' he replied, and his heart stopped beating when he saw Riley. 'Hey, buddy. Slow down,' he said when he saw Riley taking two cookies at the same time. 'The whole jar is for you. You might cough if you eat this fast.' 

'Sorry, Dad.' Riley slowed down and smiled. 'You just make the best cookies. I got hungry.'

'I am glad you like them, buddy. I will make some more,' he beamed proudly and rubbed his hands in Riley's honey-colored hair. It was his favorite thing to do. And he was relishing every moment of it. But something was bothering him. He didn't want to ask this. But he knew he had to. He patted Riley's leg. 'How's your leg? Is it any better?'

He nodded. 'Yeah, Dad. It's better,' he flung it in the air, 'see, Dad,' his dimples welcomed his face, 'I can fly with it. Mommy puts ointments on it so that I can fly. I will fly like a big birdie.'

Harry smiled. 'You sure can, champ.' He looked at Riley's leg. It looked healthy now. He silently prayed for it to heal properly. And then they might go for a walk again. 

For some time, they sat in silence. In a warm room. Looking outside the window. Feeling the rain as they could hear the rain falling on the ground softly. It was a beautiful moment. It felt unreal.

'When will it stop raining?'

This question felt like a bomb on Harry's heart. He hesitated before answering. 'I don't know, son. It has been raining since morning.'

'It rains there too, dad. In our other home. And it keeps on raining for hours.'

'And… do you like it? The rain? Do you go for a walk with Mommy?'

'Yes, Dad. I love rain. Mommy loves it too,' he took another bite of the cookie, 'she says it sets us free.'

Harry's heart missed a beat. 'What else does she say?'

Riley thought about it. 'I don't remember,' he smiled guiltily, 'she says a lot of things,' he started counting on his fingertips, 'she talks about the sun, the trees, the food, and the cars, and about other things, dad. She talks about everything.'

'Yeah. She loves to talk,' he smiled and ran his fingers in Riley's hair, 'you got beautiful hair. Do you know that, buddy?'

Riley blushed and shook his head. 'No, daddy,' he whispered.

'Oh, my beautiful boy,' Harry wrapped his arms around Riley, 'you know, son. I missed you. I miss you every single day. I can't stop thinking about you,' his voice caught in his throat, 'do you… miss me, champ?'

Riley stopped eating. His eyes were sparkling as he nodded his head. 'Nope.'

Harry's heart sank. Oh. It felt as if it drowned in an ocean. It felt like as if it was crushed by the sunlight. But it was okay. Riley was just six. He was demanding too much from the boy. 

'Dad?' Riley's asked, and Harry felt his voice was laced with an unnamed emotion. 

'Yeah, buddy.'

'I don't miss you, Dad. Because I remember you all the time. You are in my heart,' Riley's adorable face was smiling now as he put his hand over his heart. Harry felt his heart would surely break now. 'You are here,' he whispered, 'you will always be here. In my heart,' he smiled, 'you know, dad, I get lonely too. Sometimes I become sad too. But Mommy helps me, Dad. She hugs me when I am sad. She tells me that dad loves me too.'

Harry felt a tear dabbing his eyes. 'I wish I could be there with you too, buddy. I wish I could hug you when you feel sad. Or lonely.'

Riley's face brightened. 'Really?'

'Really,' he smiled. 'I would love to hug my son and never let him go.'

'Yaayyyy!!!'

Harry smiled. 'Yay!' He wiped off that stray tear and calmed himself, 'how's Mommy, son?' His voice was heavy. It broke. 'Is… Mommy okay? Is her back okay?'

'She is okay, Dad. She cries. Sometimes. Sometimes her back hurts. Sometimes she misses you. And she cries the whole night.'

Something broke inside Harry. He wanted to call her, hear her voice, feel her warmth, look at her brownish eyes, see her beautiful smile, feel the softness of her hair. He wanted to hug her and tell her he missed her. That this house doesn't feel like home. He wanted to tell her that he wakes up every night because the bed feels alien without her. Sometimes he thinks of writing a letter, but he doesn't want her to be sad. Since that terrible day, he knew he had to let go. But it was so difficult. His eyes were wet, but he didn't want to cry in front of his son. Reaching out for Riley's hand, he gently squeezed it, 'Will you tell Mommy that I miss her too?'

'You do, Dad?'

'I do, champ, I do,' Harry whispered. 'I miss her so much.'

Riley smiled. He was genuinely happy. 'I will tell Mommy. She will be very happy. But Dad?'

'Yes, buddy?'

'Why can't we live together, Dad? Like we used to? I miss you,' Riley sobbed. His eyes were watery. 

Harry heard a bird chirping outside the window. The rain wasn't splattering against the window panes now. It was much calm, and he sighed while a tear rolled down his cheeks. And this time, he didn't care to wipe it off. He let it fall down his face. There was silence. He looked at the table, and there was an untouched cookie jar and the birthday present. 'My, boy. I miss you too,' he sobbed in an empty dark room while the rain washed over the shore.`,
